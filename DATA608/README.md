DATA 608 - Knowledge and Visual Analytics

In this course, non-statistical aspects of elucidating from data its information content which leads to
knowledge was learned. Several differing visual techniques were examined to gain knowledge through exploratory use of visualizations
as well as visualization techniques for presenting data to a variety of stakeholders. Exploratory techniques look to find patterns
in the data. Finding patterns that underlie the system's characteristics when the data sets are very large or have many
dimensions by reducing the dimensionality in intelligent ways is a complex task that often includes user direction. Presentation
visualizations provide the viewer with useful information and knowledge since the visualizations are created with context in
mind. In addition, quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., text and narrative) were explored.
