## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}
#search for articles
APIkey <- "&api-key=K5dRA2CI1W5NBQesMENCsbvhsKCwBBKF"
url <- "http://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/picks.json?order=by-date"
req <- fromJSON(paste0(url, APIkey))
reviews <- req$results
colnames(reviews)
```
```{r}
reviews[1:20, c("display_title", "opening_date", "publication_date", "mpaa_rating")]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
