DATA 605 - Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

This course covered basic differential and integral calculus from the viewpoint of numerical methods and some basic probability concepts. The emphasis was on modeling and applications to a number of different fields that make use of analytics in differing ways: e.g., business, urban systems, social networks. The course incorporated basic linear and matrix algebra. Statistical programming and modeling packages were used throughout.
