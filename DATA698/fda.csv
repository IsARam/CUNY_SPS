Additives included are those specified in the regulations promulgated under the FD&C Act, under Sections 401 (Food Standards), and 409 (Food Additives). The Food Additives Status List includes short notations on use limitations for each additive. For complete information on its use limitations, refer to the specific regulation for each substance. New regulations and revisions are published in current issues of the  as promulgated. Also refer to the  in the Foods section of the FDA  web site to review several FDA databases of additive categories.
